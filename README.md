these are my small college projects 

subject attendence -The Attendance Management System is a Java-based application designed to simplify and automate the process of tracking student or employee attendance. It provides an efficient alternative to manual record-keeping by offering features such as secure login, attendance marking, real-time updates, and easy data retrieval. The system allows users to add, update, and manage records through a clean and intuitive interface built using Java and Swing, ensuring smooth navigation and usability. Although the project is still in development, it already includes core attendance functionalities and database connectivity, and I am act

world time- The World Digital Clock is a Python-based GUI application built using Tkinter and the TimeAPI service to display real-time date and time information for multiple locations across the world. The app features an interactive world map where users can click on any marked city to instantly view its current time, date, and day of the week. Each location dynamically loads a themed background—morning, evening, or night—based on the city’s local hour, making the interface visually engaging and intuitive. The project integrates external APIs, dynamic image rendering with Pillow (PIL), custom canvas layouts, and precise coordinate mapping to create an immersive global time-viewing experience. Although still under development, the app already includes dozens of cities, custom icons, visual themes, and a clean UI, and I am actively improving the design, optimizing the button placements, and adding more smart interactions. This project demonstrates strong skills in Python, Tkinter UI design, API integration, and graphical interface enhancement.

cgpa calculator - The Multi-Student GPA Calculator is a Java Swing application designed to manage multiple students, store their course details, and calculate accurate GPAs using a clean and intuitive interface. The program allows users to add students with validated names and SRNs, enter multiple courses with credits and grades, and dynamically update a table that displays all entered details. It supports secure file storage by exporting student records as CSV files protected with a password hashed using SHA-256, and includes a file browser to reopen saved records after verification. The system handles multiple students independently, maintains a structured data model using HashMaps and custom classes, and ensures strong input validation through regex patterns. This project demonstrates practical skills in Java Swing UI design, data structures, file handling, hashing, table models, and creating real-world desktop applications with multi-user support.
